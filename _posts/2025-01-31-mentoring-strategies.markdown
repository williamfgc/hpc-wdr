As we hit application deadlines for summer internship programs at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), it's a good time to reflect on some mentoring strategies I found useful to effectively impact our experience.

### Why Mentoring?
The impact of mentoring and our internship programs can't be overstated. Many current lab staff, including myself, were interns during our formative years. Internships can be life changing experiences that allow students to absorb our culture, dynamics, have a glance at their future-selfs, and to understand the value of National Labs.

### What is a Mentor?
We asked ChatGPT: `A mentor is an experienced and trusted advisor who provides guidance, support, and encouragement to someone less experienced, often referred to as a mentee. The relationship is typically based on knowledge transfer, personal development, and professional growth. Mentors offer advice, share their expertise, help set goals, and offer constructive feedback to help mentees navigate challenges, make informed decisions, and advance in their careers or personal lives.` 
Read carefully, because a mentor is not a supervisor, manager, or a guardian.

## Finding Talent
The first step is to build a team. I tend to look for interns with complimentary skills than can learn from each other.

Rather than a proven track record, I look for:

- the things they describe with passion in their essay
- their grades in core subjects (of course!)
- aspects highlighted in their letters of recommendation

The next step is to set up a virtual call with the candidate and asks questions about the above and why they applied. I also explain the scope of the project and the topics they will doing
