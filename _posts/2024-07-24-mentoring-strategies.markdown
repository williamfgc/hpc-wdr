As we wrap up the summer internship season at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), it's a good time to reflect on some mentoring strategies I found useful to effectively impact our experience.

### Why Mentoring?
The impact of mentoring and our internship programs can't be overstated. Many current lab staff, including myself, were interns during our formative years. Internships can be life changing experiences that allow students to absorb our culture, dynamics, have a glance at their future-selfs, and to understand the value of National Labs.

### How to Prepare
One of : **recreate game conditions during training**

## Finding Talent
The first step is to build a team. I tend to look for interns with complimentary skills than can learn from each other.

Rather than a proven track record, I look for:

- the things they describe with passion in their essay
- their grades in core subjects (of course!)
- aspects highlighted in their letters of recommendation

The next step is to set up a virtual call with the candidate and asks questions about the above and why they applied. I also explain the scope of the project and the topics they will doing
